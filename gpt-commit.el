;;; Commentary:
;;
;; GPT-Commit is an Emacs package that automates the generation of
;; conventional commit messages.  By leveraging the power of GPT
;; (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, it suggests structured
;; commit messages following the conventional commit format.
;;
;; With GPT-Commit, you no longer need to spend time crafting commit
;; messages manually.  It analyzes the changes in your Git repository and
;; generates meaningful commit messages automatically, ensuring
;; consistent and descriptive commit logs.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Automatic generation of conventional commit messages
;; - Integration with Git and Magit for seamless workflow
;; - Easy configuration and customization
;;
;; GPT-Commit streamlines the commit process and promotes best practices
;; for commit message formatting.  By using consistent commit messages,
;; you can enhance project clarity, facilitate collaboration, and improve
;; the overall maintainability of your codebase.

# Conventional Commits 1.0.0

## Summary

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.
It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history;
which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.
This convention dovetails with [SemVer](http://semver.org),
by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

---

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
---

<br />
The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the
consumers of your library:

1. **fix:** a commit of the _type_ `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with [`PATCH`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
1. **feat:** a commit of the _type_ `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with [`MINOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
1. **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [`MAJOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.
1. _types_ other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, for example [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) (based on the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)) recommends `build:`, `chore:`,
  `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
1. _footers_ other than `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` may be provided and follow a convention similar to
  [git trailer format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers).

Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE).
<br /><br />
A scope may be provided to a commit's type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.")

This function is a hook intended to be added to `git-commit-setup-hook'.
When called, it analyzes the changes in the Git repository and generates
a conventional commit message using the GPT model.

The generated commit message follows the conventional commit format,
providing a structured description of the changes made in the commit.

To use this feature, make sure you have set the OpenAI API key and
GPT model name in the respective variables:
- `gpt-commit-openai-key'
- `gpt-commit-model-name'

Example usage:
  (require 'gpt-commit)
  (setq gpt-commit-openai-key \"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY\")
  (setq gpt-commit-model-name \"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k\")
